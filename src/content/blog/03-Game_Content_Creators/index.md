In this post I will maintain a list of my favorite content creators, with links and a brief summary of their focus on their channels. I think it's a great use of time to watch some of their videos for inspiration, as well as entry-points into topics of interest.

<span style="color:cyan">_Unity development_</span>  
[**Sebastian Lague**](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) (my favorite by a large margin)  
General topics in game development, all produced with the Unity Engine.

<span style="color:cyan">_General Development_</span>  
[**SimonDev**](https://www.youtube.com/@simondev758)  
A mix of techniques for certain features, optimizations, and explanation of some CS concepts.

[**One Lone Coder**](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9)  
A variety of deep dives into topics such as graphics programming and procedural generation, presented in a very educational manner.

[**Vercidium**](https://www.youtube.com/@Vercidium)  
A handful of videos about optimizations and game engines.

<span style="color:cyan">_Unreal Engine Infrastructure_</span>  
[**Alex Forsythe**](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexForsythe)  
Although he only has a couple videos, he has probably the most informative videos on the internet about how Unreal is structured. However, I don't understand it very well.

<span style="color:cyan">_Hazel Game Engine_</span>  
[**TheCherno**](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno/featured)  
Videos about his own game engine called "Hazel". Also has general game development topics.

<span style="color:cyan">_Pixel art_</span>  
[**Aarthificial**](https://www.youtube.com/@aarthificial)  
General game development, with an emphasis on 2D pixel art.

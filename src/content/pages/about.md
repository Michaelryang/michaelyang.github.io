## Michael Yang - Game Developer based in Nevada.

**Welcome to my page!** I'm Michael Yang, a game developer and enthusiast residing in Nevada. I'm currently employed at [Heavy Iron Studios](https://heavyiron.games/) as an Associate Game Developer. Outside of work, I enjoy learning more about graphics programming, procedural generation, and other topics in games that interest me. When I'm not coding, you can find me pursuing a variety of hobbies such as playing the piano, bboying, or playing games with my friends. 

## Skills and Expertise

By and large, the main things that I work with on a day-to-day basis are Unreal Engine 5 and C++. On the side, I've worked with Unity and C#, and have sparing exposure to Godot. My work experience takes me to many different areas of UE5, and I'm not afraid to jump into unfamiliar terrority within the extensive Unreal features.

I also produce my own music and SFX in FL Studio 20, and I hope to use these skills professionally one day!

## How did I make this website?

This website is derived from an Astro template called [Dante](https://github.com/JustGoodUI/dante-astro-theme), hosted on Github Pages. If you're interested in learning more, you can check out [the Astro website](https://astro.build/) for documentation and templates.

## Get in Touch

If you have questions or inquiries, don't be afraid to reach out to me; I'd be happy to make a new connection.

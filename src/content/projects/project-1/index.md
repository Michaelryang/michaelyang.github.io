![Raytracer](/src/content/projects/project-1/raytracer.jpg)

Although this was not a full-fledged project at the time, I'll nonetheless create a post about this to get something on here (also, this website template doesn't have a null check for the tag list, so I needed to have at least one tag to prevent errors). Earlier this month, I followed a tutorial called [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview) by Peter Shirley. There was a lot of introductory concepts that served as a good way to become aware of what goes on behind the scenes of a raytracer. My goal wasn't to master the creation of raytracers though - I simply wanted an idea of how it worked, and by the end I successfully produced the charming picture of spheres shown above.

Perhaps in the future I will return to raytracers within a game engine environment and produce some nice visual renders. For now though, this .ppm image will have to do.
